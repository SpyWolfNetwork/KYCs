# KYCs

Know Your Customer (KYC) standards are designed to protect the crypto industry against fraud, corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing.

Every project owner goes through the following steps before the KYC certificate is given:
- ID Verification
- Video statement
- Video interview with devs
- Owner's wallet verification
